## Quick simulation of some membrane component dynamics

The videos show examples of the simulation running for different 'particle' sizes. They can be viewed [here](https://cszego.github.io/membranesim/) or downloaded using the links below:

[Small Particle](https://github.com/cszego/membranesim/raw/refs/heads/main/small_particle.mp4)

[Medium Particle](https://github.com/cszego/membranesim/raw/refs/heads/main/medium_particle.mp4)

[Large Particle](https://github.com/cszego/membranesim/raw/refs/heads/main/large_particle.mp4)

To change the parameters and run the simulation, use the MATLAB code. An easy way to do this is to use MATLAB online (free with a university email). Just use [this link](https://drive.mathworks.com/sharing/995980bb-b4d8-4401-8466-fbdeb4c1645a), select the file, and click "Open in MATLAB Online". However, MATLAB Online tends to be slow sometimes, so the best way to run the code is to download the file and run it in the desktop application.
